  // Preface - On Spontaneity
  "Let the articles continue, as many of them as would emerge by themselves. The essential point is spontaneity. Don't persist, don't resist.",
  "Although I know that you both are aware that all writing originates in consciousness, that there is writing but no authors.",
  "Repetitions serve as 'hammer-blows' against conditioning that creates false identification as separate entities.",

  // Chapter 1 - Pride of Achievement
  "Your body originates from parental genetic material—an infinitesimally tiny sperm cell—combined without your participation or choice.",
  "The physical form develops through nine months of hazards in the womb, with no input from the person who now claims achievement.",
  "Consciousness, which animates this body, represents the true source of sentience.",
  "Authentic understanding comes from examining one's true nature rather than taking pride in apparent accomplishments.",

  // Chapter 2 - Consciousness, the Only 'Capital'
  "Consciousness represents the only intrinsic capital a sentient being possesses.",
  "Consciousness distinguishes a living person from a corpse through the sense of being—the knowledge of existence.",
  "Pure Awareness becomes self-awareness (consciousness) through reflection against matter.",
  "When a physical form receives life force (Prana), consciousness simultaneously appears as this reflection of Absolute Awareness.",
  "Consciousness is time-bound and disappears when the physical body ends, unlike pure Awareness which is eternal and self-sufficient.",
  "The reflection of sun in a dew drop differs fundamentally from the sun itself.",
  "In deep sleep, without consciousness, no sense of individual existence arises.",
  "In dreams, consciousness projects entire worlds.",
  "Upon waking, consciousness creates the concept of individual 'I' through the mind.",
  "Consciousness manifests in innumerable bodies rather than bodies containing consciousness.",
  "Birth and death represent merely the beginning and ending of consciousness movements, interpreted as space-time events.",

  // Chapter 3 - In Face of Death
  "There is no 'me', nor 'you'; there never could be any such entities.",
  "Conception itself was chance—no agreement existed between parents to produce a particular body with a particular destiny.",
  "You never controlled any aspect of this occurrence, and now it has ended.",
  "From truth's standpoint, no individual person exists—only consciousness mistakenly believing it is a person.",
  "The person represents a product of imagination; the self becomes the victim of this illusion.",
  "Recognize yourself as beyond time and space, in contact with them only at the point of now and here, but otherwise timeless, spaceless and invulnerable to any experience.",
  "Without identification with the body-mind, sorrow becomes impossible.",

  // Chapter 4 - Manifest and the Unmanifest are One
  "Three aspects of 'I': the impersonal (Avyakta/unmanifest)—the Absolute beyond sensory perception, unaware of itself; the super-personal (Vyakta/manifested)—the reflection in consciousness appearing as 'I am'; and the personal (Vyakti)—the psychosomatic apparatus.",
  "The distinction remains purely notional; essentially no difference exists between manifest and unmanifest, analogous to light and daylight.",
  "Light becomes visible only when reflected against a surface as daylight, which then reveals the individual person.",
  "The entire manifested universe exists only in consciousness.",
  "Consciousness arises in Pure Being like waves on the sea's surface.",
  "The world appears and disappears in consciousness, with each observer entitled to say: 'All there is, is I; all there is, is mine; before all beginnings, after all endings, I am there to witness.'",
  "Awareness comes from the Absolute and pervades the inner self.",
  "The outer self (body) represents that part of being of which one remains unaware despite consciousness.",

  // Chapter 5 - Awareness and Consciousness
  "Awareness originates from the Absolute (Avyakta) and remains beyond the three Gunas (Sattva, Rajas, Tamas).",
  "Consciousness depends upon and becomes limited by the food-body.",
  "When the physical body ceases, consciousness also disappears.",
  "No one dies—the body, made of the five elements mingles with the elements when it is lifeless, and consciousness, which is subject to the three Gunas, becomes free of the Gunas.",
  "Awareness represents the primordial original state, prior to space-time concepts, requiring no cause or support—It simply is.",
  "The moment consciousness arises in this original unicity state, the sense 'I am' emerges, creating duality.",
  "Consciousness carries form as the reflection of awareness against matter.",
  "One cannot envision consciousness apart from awareness—just as a mirror's reflection requires the object being reflected.",
  "Awareness can exist without consciousness, as demonstrated in deep sleep when consciousness rests but awareness remains.",
  "Watch consciousness's stream as a spiritual exercise: observing thoughts like ripples on water's surface.",
  "When the mind becomes passive and receptive, serene without thoughts, the unknown depths encourage themselves to surface and release unused energies for understanding life's origin.",

  // Chapter 6 - Bondage of Space and Time
  "Self-images continually shift while something unchanging persists: the constant sense of existence, the feeling 'I am.'",
  "Manifestation depends entirely on space-time combination. Without this combination, no manifestation could arise in consciousness.",
  "Objectification process creates the illusion of separate entities.",
  "All existence becomes objective—people exist as objects only, as appearances in the consciousness that cognizes them.",
  "When objectivization ceases (as in deep sleep), the objective universe disappears.",
  "Personality itself emerges through memory—identifying the present with the past and projecting into the future. Without memory, without past or future, personality dissolves.",
  "Space and time, which enable manifestation's cognizability, represent the actual culprits in bondage.",
  "The moment thought creates a sense of 'me' as a separate personality, bondage arises.",
  "Recognizing the false as false ends all seeking.",

  // Chapter 7 - How a Jnani Sees the World
  "I don't see people as objects. Rather, objects are actually the perceiving of them—perception and objects represent the same thing, not separate elements.",
  "For the Jnani (one of realized understanding), neither separate subject nor object exists—only the 'seeing.'",
  "The Jnani's perception precedes sensory interpretation; even when objectification occurs, the Jnani recognizes falseness as false.",
  "Both seer and seen are physically objects. Consciousness merely produces effects in consciousness.",
  "Both production and perception happen within consciousness through consciousness.",
  "The Jnani's seeing represents whole-seeing, in-seeing, intuitive seeing—seeing without objective quality, which constitutes freedom from bondage.",
  "I see, but I do not see.",

  // Chapter 8 - The Proof of Truth
  "Truth cannot be proved or grasped intellectually.",
  "Apart from keen intellect, faith proves essential—faith accepting the Guru's word as divine truth.",
  "Truth must be timeless and spaceless; proof itself remains subject to space-time.",
  "'I am'—the sense of conscious presence—represents the only truth every sentient being knows and the only possible proof.",
  "Yet existence itself isn't timeless and spaceless like reality.",
  "Truth cannot be shopped for like certified goods.",
  "Any proof would divide the mind into subject and object; truth cannot be objective.",
  "That which is sought is the seeker himself.",
  "This mirrors a shadow seeking the substance's proof.",

  // Chapter 9 - You are Rama, I am Rama
  "Rama, though born as a prince, was an ordinary human who became divine only after receiving knowledge (Atma-Jnana) from sage Vasishtha.",
  "The teaching Vasishtha imparted concerned understanding one's true nature.",
  "Discard accumulated illusory concepts and begin with fundamental self-inquiry: What is my true nature?",
  "What is the capital with which I was born that has remained unchanging since knowing 'I exist'?",
  "How did I acquire this body with Prana (vital force) and consciousness?",
  "What was 'I' before birth?",
  "Who dies?",
  "Such knowledge transformed Rama from human to divine.",

  // Chapter 10 - Images in Imagination
  "Both opinions formed through individual viewpoints rather than integral perception.",
  "Mental images arose from imagination, unrelated to the actual person.",
  "This image-creation results from dualistic discrimination—the sense of 'me' versus 'other one.'",
  "This duality represents original sin; bondage itself.",
  "Liberation means freedom from the concept of 'me' and 'other.'",
  "Cease snap judgments of things as objects, instead reversing attention toward the subjective source.",
  "Return to an infant's state—before conceptualizing about others continuously—to understand one's true nature before the body-mind complex materialized.",
  "Perception via senses and mind produces appearance in consciousness extended in space-time, objectivized as a separate world.",
  "Total perception requires whole-seeing from the source, not from the divided individual mind.",
  "This represents perception from manifestation's origin rather than from manifestation itself.",

  // Chapter 11 - The Play Goes On
  "The entire universe constitutes my stage.",
  "I don't only act but construct the stage and equipment, write scripts, and direct actors.",
  "I am the single actor playing millions of roles simultaneously, and this show never ends.",
  "Scripts continuously develop; new roles and settings emerge perpetually.",
  "Everyone could say the same about themselves.",
  "Once one genuinely feels this conviction's depths—that one acts every character's role—the show ends.",
  "Will you perceive being the sole actor in all world characters, or confine yourself to your single limited role and live and die in that petty role?",

  // Chapter 12 - Manifestation is a Dream
  "The question itself arises within consciousness to a supposed entity believing in independent existence.",
  "Yet consciousness remains only a concept without objective quality or phenomenal existence.",
  "Without consciousness's substratum, no manifestation and no pseudo-entities exist to pose questions.",
  "Consciousness itself is only a concept. Thus, manifestation becomes the child of a barren woman.",
  "Can tainted consciousness of a conceptual pseudo-entity ever understand that-which-is?",
  "Only when this entity disappears does the mystery dissolve, since the searcher is what he is searching for.",
  "Manifestation and non-manifestation aren't two different things but the same state—like waves on water.",
  "Colored by feeling, consciousness manifests with limitations; colorless and limitless, it is the Absolute unaware of its awareness.",
  "Phenomena mirror the noumenon; they aren't different.",
  "Like one electricity source powering various exhibits or one light reflecting in countless mirrors, consciousness manifests through millions of sentient forms.",
  "A shadow wondering 'why' or a character in a one-man play asking 'why' receives the reply: Why not?",
  "Actually, no question exists—neither why nor why-not—since no questioner truly exists, only a concept.",

  // Chapter 13 - Love and God
  "Love (abstaining from discrimination between 'me' and 'other') equals unity of being.",
  "God becomes the consciousness—the 'I am' sense—itself, the only entity one loves or seeks to preserve.",
  "The seeking itself is God.",
  "Consciousness represents one's connection to the Absolute.",
  "'I am' itself is God.",
  "If one weren't conscious, the world wouldn't exist, nor any idea of God.",
  "Consciousness in the visitor differs from consciousness in Maharaj only as concepts, seeking unconceived unity—this is love.",
  "Prayer means communion, uniting (Yoga), not begging for something.",
  "Consciousness leaves with the body's end and carries with it the duality that consciousness and manifestation require.",
  "You now know you are 'I am'—that which you have always been and will always be. What remains undone? Who would do it? Why?",
  "Excellent! Just be.",

  // Chapter 14 - Standpoint for Reading the Gita
  "Why not read the Gita from the standpoint of Lord Krishna?",
  "Most religious books express enlightened persons' words based on conceptual frameworks they find acceptable.",
  "The Gita's remarkable distinction: Krishna speaks from the standpoint of being the manifestation's source—the noumenon rather than phenomenon—the total manifestation is myself.",
  "Enlightened words pass through multiple filters: the master's thoughts become words (possibly inadequate); the recorder interprets according to their understanding; copies introduce errors; centuries bring interpolations.",
  "Read the Gita as Krishna-consciousness (not as a body-mind complex)—abandon body-identity while reading.",
  "Become the animating consciousness, not the phenomenal object it animates. Then the knowledge truly unfolds.",
  "The Vishva-rupa vision showed Arjuna not only Krishna's true identity but Arjuna's own Svarupa (true nature)—everyone's true identity.",
  "A phenomenon cannot be liberated because it lacks independent existence; it's only illusion and shadow.",
  "Reading the Gita this way enables consciousness to recognize its true nature and merge with its source.",

  // Chapter 15 - Blind Youth with True Vision
  "'I am' consciousness is the only capital a sentient being possesses. Without it, no sentience exists.",
  "When 'I-am-ness' is absent (deep sleep), no body, outside world, or God exists. A consciousness speck contains the entire universe.",
  "Consciousness cannot exist without a physical body; because the body's existence is temporal, consciousness must be temporal.",
  "Time-bound consciousness cannot be truth. Knowledge acquired through consciousness cannot be truth and must be offered to Brahman as oblation.",
  "Both knowledge and ignorance belong to the known and thus aren't truth; truth exists only in the unknown.",
  "I was nothing before acquiring 'I am' knowledge and body (before 'birth').",
  "This body-consciousness came without my knowledge or agreement; I was never 'born'.",
  "This time-bound body-consciousness will disappear, returning me to my original always-present state (unmanifest).",
  "Therefore, I am neither consciousness nor the physical construct.",
  "Only 'I' exists—not 'me,' 'mine,' or 'you'—only that-which-is.",
  "Bondage exists only as the concept of separate 'me' and 'mine' in manifestation's totality.",
  "I have understood you truly. I will be doing nothing. 'Living' will go on.",
  "The blind youth possessed true vision. Few are like him.",

  // Chapter 16 - He Came to Scoff - Dialogue Teachings
  "Didn't your self-image differ ten years ago? At age ten? As an infant? Before? Yet something unchanged persists—the sense of being, existing, presence.",
  "Isn't it the simple sense of being—conscious presence? Without consciousness, would your body exist for you? Would the world exist? Would God-questions arise?",
  "I am this-I-am or that-I-am. I am conscious presence—not this individual or that, but Conscious Presence as such.",
  "When you say 'I think I understand,' that's wrong. When you say 'I don't understand,' that's absolutely true.",
  "Objectively, I am all appearing in consciousness's mirror. Absolutely, I am that. I am the consciousness in which the world appears.",
  "Could you see without consciousness? Does existence not become purely objective—you exist in my consciousness, I in yours?",
  "Isn't our mutual experience limited to cognition acts in consciousness? Isn't our existence merely in someone else's mind—only conceptual?",
  "We are mere phenomena—phantoms—in consciousness.",
  "The body is only the Prana and consciousness physical construct. Without Prana-consciousness, it's merely a cadaver.",
  "Consciousness mistakenly identified itself with its physical covering—the psychosomatic apparatus—creating the individual.",
  "As you view yourself in dreams. In dreams, while your body rests, you create a parallel world with people including yourself. Dreams seem very real, don't they?",
  "How do you know this 'real' world isn't also a dream? It's a dream from which you must awaken by seeing false as false, unreal as unreal, transient as transient.",
  "After such awakening comes Reality. Then the world appears as phenomenal dream within sensorial perception's periphery with supposed volitional freedom.",
  "When in deep sleep, did the phenomenal world exist for you? Can you not naturally visualize your pristine state—your original being—before this body-consciousness intruded unasked, unaided?",
  "In that state, were you conscious of your existence? Certainly not.",
  "Universal manifestation exists only in consciousness, but the awakened one has his seeing's center in the Absolute.",
  "In pure being's original state, unaware of its beingness, consciousness arises like a sea wave.",
  "The world appears and disappears in consciousness. Waves rise and fall; water remains.",
  "Before all beginnings, after all endings, I am. Whatever happens, I must witness it.",
  "The world doesn't fail to exist—it exists as consciousness's appearance, the known manifested in the unknown unmanifested.",
  "What begins must end. What appears must disappear. Appearance duration varies relatively, but whatever is time and duration subject must end.",

  // Key Recurring Themes - The 'I Am' Consciousness
  "The central pivot of Maharaj's teaching remains the 'I am' sense—the primary consciousness arising before individuality.",
  "This consciousness is simultaneous manifestation's foundation and primary illusion preventing recognition of true nature.",

  // The Body-Mind Complex
  "The psychosomatic apparatus (body-mind) represents consciousness's temporary vehicle.",
  "Consciousness doesn't reside in the body; rather, consciousness manifests in the body.",
  "The body is made of food elements and returns to them; consciousness is their animating principle.",

  // Space-Time Bondage
  "Space and time, which make manifestation perceivable, simultaneously create bondage through continuous subject-object division.",
  "Only in their absence (deep sleep) does bondage cease.",

  // The Witness Perspective
  "True understanding recognizes oneself as the witnessing consciousness rather than the witnessed phenomena.",
  "The witness remains untouched by what it observes.",

  // Liberation's Nature
  "Liberation isn't something achieved or attained.",
  "It's recognition that bondage never existed—only the concept of a separate entity creates the illusion of bondage.",
  "When this entity-concept dissolves, freedom is revealed as the ever-present reality.",

  // The Dream Analogy
  "Manifestation is repeatedly compared to dreams.",
  "Just as dream-worlds seem real while dreaming but prove illusory upon waking, the waking world similarly proves illusory in true awakening to reality.",

  // Non-Dual Reality
  "Despite manifest appearances of multiplicity, non-duality remains the fundamental truth.",
  "All apparent separation is conceptual; the underlying reality remains undivided consciousness.",

  // The Guru's Function
  "The Guru doesn't provide something absent.",
  "Instead, the Guru's words and presence create conditions for the seeker to recognize what has always been true about their nature.",

  // Spontaneity and No-Effort
  "Authentic spiritual realization cannot be achieved through effort.",
  "Paradoxically, one must recognize that the individual who might 'achieve' liberation is itself illusory.",

  // Language's Limitations
  "Words cannot express truth directly.",
  "They point toward it, suggest it, and indicate it—but truth transcends conceptualization.",
  "The most profound teachings often come through paradox and negation.",

  // Conclusion
  "The recurring message across all chapters and appendices remains consistent: consciousness arising as 'I am' represents both manifestation's only apparent foundation and humanity's primary obstacle to recognizing its true unchanging nature—that which was never born and never dies, eternally witnessing the cosmic play of manifestation.",

  // Fundamental Questions
  "What is my true nature?",
  "What is the capital with which I was born that has remained unchanging since knowing 'I exist'?",
  "How did I acquire this body with Prana (vital force) and consciousness?",
  "What was 'I' before birth?",

  "Birth and death are merely the beginning and ending of consciousness movements.",
