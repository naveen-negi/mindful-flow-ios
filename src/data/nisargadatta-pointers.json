        "Consciousness distinguishes a living person from a corpse through the sense of being—the knowledge of existence.",
        "Pure Awareness becomes self-awareness (consciousness) through reflection against matter.",
        "When a physical form receives life force (Prana), consciousness simultaneously appears as this reflection of Absolute Awareness.",
        "Consciousness is time-bound and disappears when the physical body ends, unlike pure Awareness which is eternal and self-sufficient.",
        "The reflection of sun in a dew drop differs fundamentally from the sun itself.",

        "In dreams, consciousness projects entire worlds.",
        "Upon waking, consciousness creates the concept of individual 'I' through the mind.",

        "From truth's standpoint, no individual person exists—only consciousness mistakenly believing it is a person.",
        "The person represents a product of imagination; the self becomes the victim of this illusion.",
        "Recognize yourself as beyond time and space, in contact with them only at the point of now and here, but otherwise timeless, spaceless and invulnerable to any experience.",

      "teachings": [
        "Three aspects of 'I': the impersonal (Avyakta/unmanifest)—the Absolute beyond sensory perception, unaware of itself; the super-personal (Vyakta/manifested)—the reflection in consciousness appearing as 'I am'; and the personal (Vyakti)—the psychosomatic apparatus.",
        "The distinction remains purely notional; essentially no difference exists between manifest and unmanifest, analogous to light and daylight.",
        "Light becomes visible only when reflected against a surface as daylight, which then reveals the individual person.",
        "The entire manifested universe exists only in consciousness.",
        "Consciousness arises in Pure Being like waves on the sea's surface.",
        "The world appears and disappears in consciousness, with each observer entitled to say: 'All there is, is I; all there is, is mine; before all beginnings, after all endings, I am there to witness.'",
        "Awareness comes from the Absolute and pervades the inner self.",

        "Consciousness depends upon and becomes limited by the food-body.",
        "When the physical body ceases, consciousness also disappears.",
        "No one dies—the body, made of the five elements mingles with the elements when it is lifeless, and consciousness, which is subject to the three Gunas, becomes free of the Gunas.",
        "Awareness represents the primordial original state, prior to space-time concepts, requiring no cause or support—It simply is.",
        "The moment consciousness arises in this original unicity state, the sense 'I am' emerges, creating duality.",
        "Consciousness carries form as the reflection of awareness against matter.",
        "One cannot envision consciousness apart from awareness—just as a mirror's reflection requires the object being reflected.",
        "Awareness can exist without consciousness, as demonstrated in deep sleep when consciousness rests but awareness remains.",
        "Watch consciousness's stream as a spiritual exercise: observing thoughts like ripples on water's surface.",
        "When the mind becomes passive and receptive, serene without thoughts, the unknown depths encourage themselves to surface and release unused energies for understanding life's origin."

        "When objectivization ceases (as in deep sleep), the objective universe disappears.",
        "Personality itself emerges through memory—identifying the present with the past and projecting into the future. Without memory, without past or future, personality dissolves.",
        "Space and time, which enable manifestation's cognizability, represent the actual culprits in bondage.",
        "The moment thought creates a sense of 'me' as a separate personality, bondage arises.",

        "For the Jnani (one of realized understanding), neither separate subject nor object exists—only the 'seeing.'",
        "The Jnani's perception precedes sensory interpretation; even when objectification occurs, the Jnani recognizes falseness as false.",
        "Both seer and seen are physically objects. Consciousness merely produces effects in consciousness.",
        "Both production and perception happen within consciousness through consciousness.",
        "The Jnani's seeing represents whole-seeing, in-seeing, intuitive seeing—seeing without objective quality, which constitutes freedom from bondage.",

        "Truth must be timeless and spaceless; proof itself remains subject to space-time.",
        "'I am'—the sense of conscious presence—represents the only truth every sentient being knows and the only possible proof.",
        "Yet existence itself isn't timeless and spaceless like reality.",
        "Truth cannot be shopped for like certified goods.",
        "Any proof would divide the mind into subject and object; truth cannot be objective.",

        "The teaching Vasishtha imparted concerned understanding one's true nature.",
        "Discard accumulated illusory concepts and begin with fundamental self-inquiry: What is my true nature?",

        "Mental images arose from imagination, unrelated to the actual person.",
        "This image-creation results from dualistic discrimination—the sense of 'me' versus 'other one.'",
        "This duality represents original sin; bondage itself.",
        "Liberation means freedom from the concept of 'me' and 'other.'",
        "Cease snap judgments of things as objects, instead reversing attention toward the subjective source.",
        "Return to an infant's state—before conceptualizing about others continuously—to understand one's true nature before the body-mind complex materialized.",
        "Perception via senses and mind produces appearance in consciousness extended in space-time, objectivized as a separate world.",
        "Total perception requires whole-seeing from the source, not from the divided individual mind.",

        "Everyone could say the same about themselves.",
        "Once one genuinely feels this conviction's depths—that one acts every character's role—the show ends.",

        "'I am' itself is God.",

        "The Gita's remarkable distinction: Krishna speaks from the standpoint of being the manifestation's source—the noumenon rather than phenomenon—the total manifestation is myself.",
        "Enlightened words pass through multiple filters: the master's thoughts become words (possibly inadequate); the recorder interprets according to their understanding; copies introduce errors; centuries bring interpolations.",
        "Read the Gita as Krishna-consciousness (not as a body-mind complex)—abandon body-identity while reading.",
        "Become the animating consciousness, not the phenomenal object it animates. Then the knowledge truly unfolds.",
        "The Vishva-rupa vision showed Arjuna not only Krishna's true identity but Arjuna's own Svarupa (true nature)—everyone's true identity.",
        "A phenomenon cannot be liberated because it lacks independent existence; it's only illusion and shadow.",

        "Consciousness cannot exist without a physical body; because the body's existence is temporal, consciousness must be temporal.",
        "Time-bound consciousness cannot be truth. Knowledge acquired through consciousness cannot be truth and must be offered to Brahman as oblation.",

      "When objectivization ceases (deep sleep), the objective universe disappears",
      "Total perception requires whole-seeing from the source, not from the divided mind",
      "The Jnani's seeing is whole-seeing, in-seeing, intuitive seeing—without objective quality"

    "death": [
      "No one dies—the body mingles with elements when lifeless",
      "Consciousness becomes free of the Gunas when the body ends",
      "Birth and death are merely the beginning and ending of consciousness movements",
